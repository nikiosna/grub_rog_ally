# grub_rog_ally
This is just a personal repo where I'm trying to develop a grub2 input module for the Asus ROG Ally X.
I don't want to open the bios each time before I can select a boot entry (yes I know that "workaround").

Currently this is just a build dev enviroment for grub without any real development done.
